# TranSMART integration with ELIXIR AAI
This is a forked repository. You can find the most recent updates (or any help) under [https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/elixir/AAI-proxy](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/elixir/AAI-proxy).
If you'd like to use it or request any relevant information, please contact `jacek.lebioda@elixir-luxembourg.org`.

## What it is?
Integration of TranSMART and Elixir AAI, using a reverse-proxy

## Requirements
Docker CE (modern version; refer to [https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/))

## Configuration
1. Generate a server key and a certificate (a usual task for Systems Administrator), and either point to them in `Dockerfile` or replace `example.com.crt` and `example.com.key` (if you don't know how, please see _the certificates are wrong section_ below)
2. Update the information in `default-ssl.conf`, to match your needs. Minimally, you need to change:
  - `ServerAdmin` entry to your e-mail address,
  - `ServerName` and `ServerAlias` to match your domain,
  - IP addresses in `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` to point to locally accessible resources you want to protect with Elixir AAI,
  - `OICDClientID` to match your _Client ID_  received in the Dynamic Registration process of ELIXIR AAI,
  - `OICDClientSecret` to match your _Client Secret_  received in the Dynamic Registration process of ELIXIR AAI,
  - `OIDCRedirectURI` to match your domain + `/oidc-protected/`,

Optionally, you may want to update `SSLCertificateKeyFile` and `SSLCertificateFile`, if you chose to use other file names for the key and certificate.


## How to use?
First, navigate to the project's path and build the docker image with the following command
(note, that `elixir_aai_proxy` can be changed to any valid container name):
`cd path/to/the/project && docker build . -t elixir_aai_proxy`

Once the image is built, you can run the container by:
`docker run -dit -p 443:443 elixir_aai_proxy`

## Troubleshooting

### The port is already in use
`Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint [NAME_HERE] (LONG_ID_HERE): Bind for 0.0.0.0:443 failed: port is already allocated.`
Please stop other containers, that already use port 443 (see output of `docker ps | grep 443`)

### The certificates are wrong
Please create your own `example.com.crt` and `example.com.key` files using for example: `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout example.com.key -out example.com.crt`

### There is internal server error
Make sure, that:
 * OpenID Connect is configured properly in `default-ssl.conf`
 * The IPs in proxy configuration match those in OpenID Connect configuraion
 * The IPs in proxy configuration are correct, and end with a slash character (`/`)
